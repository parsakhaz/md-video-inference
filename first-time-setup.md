# Modal First Time Setup

Run this in order to install the Python library locally:

$ pip install modal
$ python3 -m modal setup

The first command will install the Modal client library on your computer, along with its dependencies.

The second command creates an API token by authenticating through your web browser. It will open a new tab, but you can close it when you are done.
